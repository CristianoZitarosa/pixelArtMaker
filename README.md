# Project: Pixel Art maker | plain JavaScript

### Brief introduction

This is a simple project to practice JavaScript in the Udacity nanodegree.
In the Google Developer Challenge it was asked to be completed in jQuery as final project.
During the nanodegree, since some of the modules were already counted as passed from the Google Challenge, I did not write this project also in plain JavaScript so I decided to do it now as personal practice.

The application consists in a grid of cells (the number is defined by the user that can set height and width) to paint with the mouse.

### Required functionalities:

- The user defines sizes of the grid;
- The user can choose different colors to paint;
- There are event listeners to control the application.

### Extra functionalities:

- Left click to paint a cell;
- Right click to clean a cell;
- 2 event listener only on the grid to improve performances, instead of potentially hundreds if set on every single cell;
- Check that the event is coming from the wanted element.

### How to run the application:
You can  run it online or download on your computer:

- [Visit this link](https://cristianozitarosa.github.io/pixelArtMaker/);

- Download the folder from git on the desktop, unzip it and open `index.html` in your browser.
